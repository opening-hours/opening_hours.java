# opening_hours.java

This repository currently contains not much more than a simple script which uses ScriptEngine from Java to use the JavaScript library [opening_hours.js][oh-lib].
All the code is based on the implementation from [JOSM](https://github.com/openstreetmap/josm/blob/mirror/src/org/openstreetmap/josm/data/validation/tests/OpeningHourTest.java) which is licensed under the GPLv2+

This repository was created to resolve a problem with opening_hours.js running on [Java 8](https://github.com/ypid/opening_hours.js/issues/52).
